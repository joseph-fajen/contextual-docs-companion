# Contextual Docs Companion

AI documentation companion with contextual intelligence. Recognizes developer experience, intent, and domain to adapt conversational style and content delivery. Three interaction patterns: Socratic Guide, Debugging Partner, Efficient Consultant. Built with N8N.

## Current Status

**Project Evolution**: This project has evolved from initial conceptual exploration to **user research-driven requirements development**. The original interaction pattern concepts remain valuable, but implementation is now contingent on validating real user needs through systematic research.

**Phase**: Problem validation and requirements refinement for documentation enhancement tools.

## Overview

This project explores innovative approaches to technical documentation through **interaction pattern adaptation**. Instead of serving the same static content to all users, the system would recognize through contextual indicators how individual developers think and work, then adapt its conversational personality and information sequencing accordingly.

### The Core Innovation

Traditional documentation systems focus on *what* to show users. This system focuses on *how* to engage with them based on:
- **User Context Recognition**: Experience level, domain expertise, current intent
- **Dynamic Content Adaptation**: Modular content assembly based on detected context  
- **Intelligent Interaction Patterns**: Three distinct AI personalities for different user needs

## The Three Interaction Patterns *(Conceptual)*

### ðŸŽ“ Socratic Guide
**For:** Learning-focused users, conceptual questions, novice developers  
**Style:** Asks leading questions, builds understanding through discovery, uses analogies  
**Example:** "What do you think deployment means in blockchain context? Let's explore..."

### ðŸ”§ Debugging Partner  
**For:** Troubleshooting scenarios, error states, urgent problem-solving  
**Style:** Collaborative investigation, systematic diagnostics, reassuring tone  
**Example:** "Let's figure this out together. What error message are you seeing?"

### âš¡ Efficient Consultant
**For:** Implementation-focused experts, rapid development, direct answers needed  
**Style:** Solution-first approach, code examples, minimal explanation  
**Example:** "Here's the deployment command: `truffle deploy --network mainnet`"

## Architecture Overview *(Conceptual)*

[Webhook]    [User/Session/Content]  [AI Personality] [Modular Content] [Contextual Delivery]
```

### Key Components
- **Context Recognition Pipeline**: Parallel analysis of user profile, session history, and content relationships
- **Interaction Pattern Router**: Intelligent selection of appropriate conversational style
- **Content Atom System**: Modular, contextually-tagged content for dynamic assembly
- **Learning Loop**: Continuous improvement based on interaction effectiveness

## Current Development Approach

### Research-First Methodology
1. **Problem Validation**: User research to validate need for documentation enhancement
2. **Requirements Refinement**: Evidence-based requirements development
3. **Technical Implementation**: Conditional on validated user needs

### Target Documentation Site
Initial research focus on [Essential Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/) as representative blockchain documentation with diverse user base and content complexity.

## Implementation Phases *(Conditional on Validation)*

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Single interaction pattern (Efficient Consultant)
- Basic context recognition (experience level)
- Core N8N workflow deployment

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition  
- All three interaction patterns active
- Advanced user profiling and session intelligence
- Content relationship mapping

### Phase 3: Learning Intelligence
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Advanced content atom system
- Dynamic optimization of contextual accuracy

## Contributing

## Research Background

This work synthesizes insights from Customer Contextual Intelligence, Information Foraging Theory, and Jobs-to-be-Done frameworks to create documentation that adapts to how developers actually think and work.

**Research Evolution**: Multi-model AI analysis (GPT, Claude, Gemini) identified critical need for user validation before technical implementation.
