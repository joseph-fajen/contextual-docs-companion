# Contextual Docs Companion

AI documentation companion with contextual intelligence. Recognizes developer experience, intent, and domain to adapt conversational style and content delivery. Three interaction patterns: Socratic Guide, Debugging Partner, Efficient Consultant. Built with N8N.

## Current Status

This is a first conceptual iteration of the project. Documents were created through dialoging with and prompting AI tools. N8N `.json` file created through AI tool prompting. The purpose of this iteration is to share concepts with others for feedback, critique, validation and brainstorming. 

## Overview

This project implements an innovative approach to technical documentation through **interaction pattern adaptation**. Instead of serving the same static content to all users, the AI companion recognizes through contextual indicators how individual developers think and work, then adapts its conversational personality and information sequencing accordingly.

### The Core Innovation

Traditional documentation systems focus on *what* to show users. This system focuses on *how* to engage with them based on:
- **User Context Recognition**: Experience level, domain expertise, current intent
- **Dynamic Content Adaptation**: Modular content assembly based on detected context  
- **Intelligent Interaction Patterns**: Three distinct AI personalities for different user needs.

## Repository Contents

### Core Documentation
- **[`concept-definition_contextual-docs-companion.md`](concept-definition_contextual-docs-companion.md)** - Initial vision, architecture, and strategic framework
- **[`concept-definition_contextual-docs-companion.txt`](concept-definition_contextual-docs-companion.txt)** - Same content in plain text format

### Implementation Guides
- **[`N8N-workflow-guide_contextual-docs-companion.md`](N8N-workflow-guide_contextual-docs-companion.md)** - Detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow implementation. Best when also viewing the N8N workflow `.json` file. 
- **[`content-authoring-system-options.md`](content-authoring-system-options.md)** - Analysis of content management approaches for contextual intelligence. It will be necessary to explore the feasibility for technical writers to adapt their content authoring methods to work with this system. 

### Prototype
- **[`N8N-workflow-first-sketch_contextual-docs-companion.json`](N8N-workflow-first-sketch_contextual-docs-companion.json)** - Importable N8N workflow demonstrating the complete system

## Quick Start

### 1. Understanding the Concept
Start with [`concept-definition_contextual-docs-companion.md`](concept-definition_contextual-docs-companion.md) to understand the vision and three core architectural dimensions.

### 2. Exploring the Workflow  
Import [`N8N-workflow-first-sketch_contextual-docs-companion.json`](N8N-workflow-first-sketch_contextual-docs-companion.json) into N8N to see the contextual intelligence system as a workflow. This is for illustration and communication purposes only so far. None of the nodes have been configured and no real functionality has yet been implemented. This is a first design sketch in N8N generated by an AI tool. 

### 3. Implementation Planning
Review [`content-authoring-system-options.md`](content-authoring-system-options.md) to choose the right content management approach for your team.

## The Three Interaction Patterns

### ðŸŽ“ Socratic Guide
**For:** Learning-focused users, conceptual questions, novice developers  
**Style:** Asks leading questions, builds understanding through discovery, uses analogies  
**Example:** "What do you think deployment means in blockchain context? Let's explore..."

### ðŸ”§ Debugging Partner  
**For:** Troubleshooting scenarios, error states, urgent problem-solving  
**Style:** Collaborative investigation, systematic diagnostics, reassuring tone  
**Example:** "Let's figure this out together. What error message are you seeing?"

### âš¡ Efficient Consultant
**For:** Implementation-focused experts, rapid development, direct answers needed  
**Style:** Solution-first approach, code examples, minimal explanation  
**Example:** "Here's the deployment command: `truffle deploy --network mainnet`"

### Key Components
- **Context Recognition Pipeline**: Parallel analysis of user profile, session history, and content relationships
- **Interaction Pattern Router**: Intelligent selection of appropriate conversational style
- **Content Atom System**: Modular, contextually-tagged content for dynamic assembly
- **Learning Loop**: Continuous improvement based on interaction effectiveness

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Single interaction pattern (Efficient Consultant)
- Basic context recognition (experience level)
- Core N8N workflow deployment

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition  
- All three interaction patterns active
- Advanced user profiling and session intelligence
- Content relationship mapping

### Phase 3: Learning Intelligence
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Advanced content atom system
- Dynamic optimization of contextual accuracy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- N8N instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Content management system (see options analysis)
- API endpoints for user context and content atoms

### Setup Steps
1. Import the N8N workflow JSON file
2. Configure API credentials and endpoints
3. Set up content atom storage system
4. Deploy webhook integration to documentation site

### Configuration
Update the following in the N8N workflow:
- API base URLs for your environment
- Authentication credentials
- Content atom schema matching your CMS

## Use Cases

### Blockchain Documentation
- **DeFi Developers**: Context-aware responses about liquidity, yield farming, protocol integration
- **NFT/GameFi Developers**: Focus on metadata, marketplace integration, real-time interactions  
- **Infrastructure Developers**: Emphasis on security, scalability, node operations

### Adaptive Content Delivery
- **Novice Users**: Conceptual explanations with analogies and progressive disclosure
- **Expert Users**: Direct code examples and advanced configuration options
- **Troubleshooting Mode**: Diagnostic questions and systematic problem-solving approaches
